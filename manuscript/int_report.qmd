# Introduction

# Methods

## Data

All data concerning the incidence rates of diabetes comes from the CDC Statistics. This contains all 50 states and territories, however, only the 50 states and the District of Columbia will be considered. In addition, the map of the 50 states and D.C. comes from Kaggle for a .json file which is read through geopandas.

## Animating the United States

Each year of diabetes incidence rates was recorded as a separate dataframe while the U.S. map was read as a geopandas dataframe. For each year, a separate map of rates was plotted and collected together to form an animation. This was done through the matplotlib.animation library using two functions. The first is an update function which changes the frame within the animation. The second in the FuncAnimation which plots the frames inside the animation.
