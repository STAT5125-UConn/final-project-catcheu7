# Introduction

# Methods

## Data Acquisition

All diabetes incidence rates are obtained from the CDC site. The map is obtained through open source in Kaggle.

## Animation

There are two functions needed for an animation:

+ A user-defined function to create the next frame.

+ FuncAnimation, which is used to combine the frames into an animation player.

The second is already provided by the matplotlib library in its animation submodule.
