# Introduction

# Methods

## Data Acquisition

All diabetes incidence rates are obtained from the CDC site. The map is obtained through open source in Kaggle.

## Animation

There are two functions the user must use to define and run an animation. The first is completely user-written and defines the next frame to put inside the animation. The second is the FuncAnimation which updates the animation with the frame in the previous function. The result is an animation which has a player to play and stop if needed.
