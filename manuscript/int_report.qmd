# Introduction

In the United States, diabetes is the seventh major cause of death in the nation. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) states that 37.3 million Americans have the disease in 2019. However, the distribution of the disease is not evenly spread. In a study in 2011, the southeastern region of the U.S. had higher rates of diabetes than others. The ADA also states that minorities have higher rates of diabetes.

Diabetes can be more easily developed through risk factors such as obesity and high blood sugar. There are studies which look into how each factor can influence the rates of diabetes. Learning how diabetes is distributed and the possible reasons for the uneven distribution can help form policies to combat the rise of diabetes and prevent diabetes-related deaths.

In this report, I will look at how the rates of diabetes has developed in the 2010s and to see how different factors affect its prevalence. This is done through a set of animations which will depict the evolution of diabetes in the nation. In addition, a linear regression model will be used to assess how different factors affect the diabetes' rates in the states.

# Methods

## Data Acquisition

All diabetes rates are obtained from the CDC site. The map is obtained through open source in Kaggle. The states are divided into four regions. Please note that Mid-Atlantic states are split between the northeast and southeast regions even though they are usually considered separate. In addition, Alaska and Hawaii are part of the western states. I used the National Geographic classification which is as follows:

```{python}
ne = ['ME','VT','NH','CT','RI','MA','NY','PA','NJ']
south = ['DC','VA','MD','DE','NC','SC','GA','FL','MS','MO','TN','KY','WV','AL','TX','AR','LA','OK']
west = ['CA','WA','OR','ID','MT','CO','WY','UT','NV','AZ','NM','AK','HI']
mw = ['MI','OH','IL','IN','IA','WI','MN','ND','SD','NE','KS']
print('Northeast: ', ne)
print('South: ', south)
print('West: ', west)
print('Midwest: ', mw)
```

The data was procured for 2010 - 2019 due to the high testing blood sugar data only from 2008 - 2020. In addition, for the ethnic groups, only the non-Hispanic white and African American data were near complete while the others have too much missing data. As such, only the first two groups will be looked at. For obesity and blood sugar, the obesity data was polled from those with diabetes while the blood sugar was taken from people without diabetes. As such, some discrepancies may come from the results due to the same population not polled for both variables.

# Results

## Animation

The following shows animations of diagnosed diabetes and high blood sugar in the U.S. Each frame is a year from 2010 - 2019. There were some missing data which appears as the highest color for the plot.

```{python echo = False}
import geopandas, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, csv, glob, shapely, sklearn
from matplotlib import rc
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import linear_model

rc('animation', html = 'jshtml')

files = glob.glob("../data/*.csv")
sugar = glob.glob("C:/Users/ccheu/final-project-catcheu7/data/sugar_data/*.csv", recursive = True)
pdfs = []
sdfs = []

for a in range(0,len(files)):
	b = pandas.read_csv(files[a], skiprows = 2)
	c = pandas.read_csv(sugar[a], skiprows = 2)
	pdfs.append(b)
	sdfs.append(c)

geous = geopandas.read_file("../data/us-states.json").rename(columns = {'name':'State'})

figure, [[ax,ax2,ax3], [ax4,ax5,ax6]] = plt.subplots(2,3,figsize = (10,10))

cbar = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(cmap = 'cool', norm = plt.Normalize(vmin = 7, vmax = 14))
plt.colorbar(cbar, ax = ax3)
cbar2 = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(cmap = 'cool', norm = plt.Normalize(vmin = 0, vmax = 60))
plt.colorbar(cbar2, ax = ax6)
plt.close()
```
```{python}

def up(z):
	gm = geous.merge(pdfs[z], on = 'State')
	su = geous.merge(sdfs[z], on = 'State')
	akg = gm[gm['State'].isin(['Alaska'])]
	aks = su[su['State'].isin(['Alaska'])]
	akg.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax2, vmin = 7, vmax = 14)

	aks.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax5, vmin = 0, vmax = 80)
	ax2.set_xlim(-170,-140)
	#akg.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax)
	ax5.set_xlim(-170,-140)
	hi = gm[gm['State'].isin(['Hawaii'])]
	hs = su[su['State'].isin(['Hawaii'])]
	hi.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax3, vmin = 7, vmax = 14)

	hs.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax6, vmin = 0, vmax = 80)
	cont = gm[~gm['State'].isin(['Alaska', 'Hawaii'])]
	cs = su[~su['State'].isin(['Alaska', 'Hawaii'])]
	cont.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax,vmin = 7,vmax = 14)

	cs.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax4,vmin = 0,vmax = 80)

	#cont.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax4)
	#cont.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax7)
	#cont.plot(column = 'Percentage', cmap = 'cool', ax = ax10)

anim = FuncAnimation(figure, up, frames = 10, interval = 1000)
plt.close()

print('Top: Percentage of People with Diabetes; Bottom: Percentage with High Blood Sugar')
anim
```

## Linear Regression

For any row with missing values, it was dropped from the dataset.

```{python}
list = pdfs + sdfs
fitpd = pandas.DataFrame()
for i in range(0,len(pdfs)):
	gpdf = geous.merge(pdfs[i].merge(sdfs[i].rename(columns = {'Percentage':'Sugar'}), on = 'State'), on = 'State')
	fitpd = pandas.concat([fitpd,gpdf])
linmod = linear_model.LinearRegression()
```

# Conclusions

In the future, I would like to take the demographics of two states and compare to see the impact of composition on the diabetes rates. In the study, I found that ethnic groups are classified as one to many races together. As such, it was too difficult to pull the data from the Census site for easy processing.
