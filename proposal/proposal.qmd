# Introduction

Diabetes is a leading cause of deaths in the United States (source).

# Aims

The overarching question for this proposal is: What are the risk factors affecting diabetes in the United States?

This will be broken into two parts:

1. How is diabetes affected across the states?
2. Is obesity a significant risk factor?

# Data

All incident rates for diabetes is at the state level from the Center of Disease Control (CDC). This is yearly data and also can have risk factors such as obesity.
However, some missing data is present in other risk factors such as high glucose tests. The data spans from 2000 to 2020, but we will only look at the 50 states so the 3 territories will not be used.
