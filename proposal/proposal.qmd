# Introduction

Diabetes is a leading cause of deaths in the United States (source).

# Aims

The overarching question for this proposal is: What are the risk factors affecting diabetes in the United States?

This will be broken into two parts:

1. How is diabetes occur across the states? Are there any differences across regions?

2. Is obesity a significant factor in the incidence of diabetes in the states?

While sugar is a major factor in diabetes, obesity could also produce co-morbid symptoms which may have diabetes. As such, it may be beneficial to see beyond sugar intake of what can influence diabetes.

# Data

All incident rates for diabetes is at the state level from the Center of Disease Control (CDC). This is yearly data and also can have risk factors such as obesity.
The data spans from 2000 to 2020, but we will only look at the 50 states so the 3 territories will not be used.

For sugar intake, we will infer based on glucose levels self-reported to CDC. However, we can only use up to 2019 as the data may have been limited by the pandemic.

The CDC also provides the incidence rates for four ethnic groups. These are Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic Asians.

# Methods

I will split the project into two methods. The first is to visualize the rates of diabetes and obesity in a map. The second is a linear regression which will observe if obesity is a significant risk factor for diabetes.

The states are split into several regions. These are Northeast, South, Midwest, and West. For this project, Alaska and Hawaii are western states.

# Discussion

Two ways of verifying obesity and diabetes rates can be found through the methods described above. The visualization provides a time-lapse into obesity and diabetes rates so that hot spots can be quickly discovered and the correlation could be more easily inferred.

The linear regression will provide a more concrete answer in whether obesity is significant to diabetes rates as well as looking into the other variables for significance.
